My name is Yuxia Wu, a research scientist at [Singapore Management University (SMU)](https://www.smu.edu.sg/), working with [Assistant Prof. Yuan Fang](https://www.yfang.site/home). I also closely collaborate with [Assistant Prof. Lizi Liao](https://liziliao.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the area of *Computer Science* at [SMILES lab](http://www.smiles-xjtu.com/), Xi'an Jiaotong University, advised by [Prof. Xueming Qian](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/qianxm). I also hold Master's and Bachelor's degrees in *Biomedical Engineering*.
